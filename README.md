This project is from the odin project foundations course(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page)

I'm going through the odin project HTML/CSS foundation course. I've already took jonas Schmedtmann Coursera HTML/CSS course, so I do have a head start. I want to have my foundations solid before I start onto learning more basic Javascript.

With this exercise I practiced using flex-box making a land page example with given styles to follow.
